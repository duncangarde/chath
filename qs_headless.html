			Political or Policy relates to leadership and establishing policies for cybersecurity strategy, planning, and risk assessment strategies in an organization. It involves implementing
			regulation and national guidelines for information and cyber security and setting up pro-
			active approaches to mitigate cyber risk.<br/><br/>
			The leadership in the organization should be able to see the bigger security environment
			and existing and emerging threats. The leadership’s role is to map out risks and threats and

			It is important for the nuclear industry to realize the costs associated in under investment in cybersecurity. Economic calculations should address who is taking the risk: is it the nuclear operators or is it underwritten by a third party such as the nuclear insurers? The insurance sector could foster awareness and create financial incentives for the businesses (e.g. discounted premiums for mature cyber security culture and behaviour).
